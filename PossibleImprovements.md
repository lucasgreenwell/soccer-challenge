1. More tests would definitely be good. 
2. More robust handling of the text, it needs a very specific input to work right now
3. More hinting/error handling with the shell arguments, this was my first CLI since school so I'd want to brush up on how you can put some guardrails in for the user
4. I'm not sure if the library I used is the best approach, some research into alternatives is probably needed
5. Stronger typing of entities like "game" and "season"
